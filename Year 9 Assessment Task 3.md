## Identifying and Defining
### PMI
#### Parking Fury
| Plus | Minus | Interesting |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| It helps people drive cars and park it. It can help people's fine motor skills and hand eye coordination as it has a rule where if you touch another car or an object you lose a life. | It doesn't have many levels, but there are multiples jobs in each level, and it doesn't have different weather conditions. | There are 3 different versions of the game, each with 10 levels each. |
#### Car Parking Master Game
| Plus | Minus | Interesting |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| It helps teach you how to park a car in different scenarios, and it help's people learn how to drive a car as well. It has obstacles on the side and if you hit it you die and have to restart the level. | The game gets boring over time as you have to repeat the same levels everytime you load in. | The game has reallife scenarios like humps and barriers. |
#### Parkmania
| Plus | Minus | Interesting |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| It has lots of obstacles to help people learn how to drive and to park their car. | It is annoying that you have to finish in an exact point even after you park in between the lines, and it is a bit unrealistic as you can drift in the game, but not in reallife. | You can't see how many levels there are in the whole game. |
### Brainstorming for Game
- Vehicle (car)
- Help with driving
- Parking
- Many levels that you can see how many at the start
- Add visibility issues like fog to recreate real life.
- Obstacles like sidewalks and other cars.
### Identify the Need
#### **Need:** 
To improve people's fine motor skills and hand-eye coordination with a fun game. 
The game is about knowing how to park your car, so it can also help young people 
(around 8-15 years old) for the future when they drive their car.
#### **Problem Statement:** 
Kids in the future will eventually drive cars, so after playing this 
game, they will know the rules of it and how to park a car. With a car parking game, people 
will learn how to park and can avoid the obstacles on the side, to help in the future
when getting their drivers licence and driving a car.
#### **Skill Development:** 
To develop the skills to make the game, I will watch Mr. Scott's tutorials for refreshing 
on how to make things move.
